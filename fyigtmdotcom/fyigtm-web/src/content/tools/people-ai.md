## What is people-ai?

People.ai is an AI-native revenue platform that automatically captures sales activities from emails, calendars, and CRM systems to provide sales, marketing, and customer success teams with actionable insights about their revenue operations. The platform addresses the persistent challenge of incomplete and inconsistent data in CRM systems by using patented AI technology to unify activity data and surface opportunities that would otherwise remain hidden in data silos.

## What the Tool Does

People.ai works behind the scenes to solve one of sales operations' biggest headaches: getting complete, accurate data about what's actually happening in your sales process. The platform automatically captures every email, meeting, and interaction your team has with prospects and customers, then uses AI to make sense of it all.

On a day-to-day basis, sales reps no longer need to manually update their CRM after every interaction. The system watches their email and calendar activity, automatically logs relevant information to Salesforce or other CRM systems, and filters out sensitive or personal content. Sales managers get a real-time view of account engagement, stakeholder coverage, and deal progression without relying on their team's data entry discipline.

The platform goes beyond simple activity logging by analyzing patterns in successful deals, identifying buying group members, and surfacing insights about deal risk and opportunity. Marketing teams can see how their campaigns actually influence sales conversations, while sales leaders get the visibility they need for accurate forecasting and targeted coaching.

## Verdict

**Bottom line:** People.ai excels at solving enterprise sales data challenges but requires significant investment and commitment.

The platform delivers genuine value for organizations wrestling with incomplete sales data and limited visibility into their revenue operations. The automated activity capture and AI-powered insights address real pain points that sales teams face daily. However, the enterprise-only pricing model and occasional technical issues mean it's not suitable for every organization. Teams considering People.ai should weigh the substantial investment against their current data challenges and ensure they have the resources for proper implementation and change management. For large B2B sales organizations with complex processes, the platform's benefits typically justify the cost, but smaller teams should explore more accessible alternatives.
