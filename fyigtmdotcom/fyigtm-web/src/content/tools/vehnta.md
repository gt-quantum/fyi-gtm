## What the Tool Does

Vehnta operates as an intelligent layer on top of your existing Google Ads campaigns, fundamentally changing how B2B marketers approach paid advertising. Instead of casting wide nets and hoping for qualified leads, the platform enables precise targeting of specific companies and decision-makers based on their actual search behaviors and intent signals.

The platform works by analyzing your current best-performing clients and identifying similar companies within its 500+ million company database. When these target companies search for relevant keywords, Vehnta captures this activity and provides daily intelligence reports through its "Just Yesterday" feature. This transforms your ad campaigns from simple lead generation tools into comprehensive market research instruments that reveal which prospects are actively researching solutions in your space.

The AI component handles much of the heavy lifting around ad creation, translation for international campaigns, and keyword optimization. Rather than spending hours crafting ad variations and managing complex targeting parameters, marketers can focus on strategy while Vehnta handles the tactical execution and optimization.

## Key Capabilities

### Company-Specific Targeting and Intelligence
Vehnta's core strength lies in its ability to target specific companies rather than broad demographic segments. The platform identifies when target companies search for premium keywords related to your solutions and provides detailed insights about their search behaviors and interest levels. This capability transforms traditional Google Ads campaigns into account-based marketing tools that can trigger personalized outreach sequences and content activation based on demonstrated intent.

### AI-Powered Campaign Creation and Optimization
The platform's AI handles the technical complexities of Google Ads management, including automatic ad creation, translation for multi-language campaigns, and continuous optimization based on performance data. This automation extends to keyword generation and search term analysis, helping marketers uncover new targeting opportunities and optimize their campaigns without requiring deep Google Ads expertise.

### Real-Time Market Intelligence
Through its "Just Yesterday" daily insights feature, Vehnta provides summaries of target company search activity, changes in interest levels, and identification of new high-value prospects. This intelligence capability allows marketing teams to understand market dynamics, identify emerging opportunities, and time their outreach efforts based on actual buyer intent signals rather than arbitrary touchpoint schedules.

## Pricing Reality

Vehnta uses a hybrid pricing model that combines a monthly subscription with usage-based credits. The structure is designed to be accessible for growing B2B companies while scaling costs with actual usage.

- **Entry cost:** €30/month base subscription plus credit costs for company targeting
- **Scaling cost:** Each credit targets one business (including subsidiaries); 5 free credits provided monthly
- **Contract terms:** Monthly subscription with 30-day free trial available

The credit system means your costs scale with the number of companies you're actively targeting rather than traditional metrics like ad spend or team size. Most teams find they need 10-20 credits monthly for meaningful coverage, putting typical costs in the €60-150 range. The platform includes real-time credit tracking to help teams manage their usage and costs effectively.

## Pros & Cons

### Pros
- **Precision targeting:** Ability to target specific companies rather than broad demographics dramatically improves lead quality and reduces wasted ad spend
- **Market intelligence integration:** Transforms ad campaigns into research tools that provide valuable insights about prospect behavior and market dynamics
- **AI automation:** Reduces the technical complexity of Google Ads management while maintaining sophisticated targeting and optimization capabilities

### Cons
- **Google Ads dependency:** Platform is exclusively focused on Google Ads, limiting value for teams using diversified advertising channels
- **Credit-based costs:** Usage-based pricing can become expensive for teams wanting to target large numbers of companies simultaneously
- **B2B limitation:** Specifically designed for B2B use cases, offering no value for B2C marketers or businesses with mixed customer bases

## What Users Say

While comprehensive third-party reviews are limited due to Vehnta being a specialized B2B tool, early adopters report significant improvements in campaign performance and lead quality.

**Common praise**
- Dramatic improvement in lead quality due to company-specific targeting capabilities
- Valuable market insights that inform broader marketing and sales strategies beyond just ad campaigns  
- Significant time savings on campaign management and optimization tasks

**Common complaints**
- Learning curve for teams transitioning from traditional demographic-based targeting approaches
- Credit costs can add up quickly when targeting large prospect lists

## Who Is It For (and Not For)

**Good fit if you are:**
- B2B marketing teams spending €2,000+ monthly on Google Ads who struggle with lead quality
- Account-based marketing programs that need better intent signal identification and targeting precision
- Marketing leaders who want to extract market intelligence insights from their advertising spend rather than just generating leads

**Not a fit if you are:**
- B2C businesses or companies with primarily consumer-focused offerings
- Early-stage startups with very limited advertising budgets or teams not actively running Google Ads campaigns
- Organizations primarily using other advertising platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, or programmatic display advertising

## Verdict

**Bottom line:** Vehnta offers a compelling solution for B2B marketers who want to transform their Google Ads campaigns from spray-and-pray approaches into precision targeting and intelligence-gathering systems.

The platform excels at solving the fundamental challenge most B2B marketers face with Google Ads: generating high-quality leads from prospects who are genuinely in-market for their solutions. By combining company-specific targeting with real-time intent intelligence, Vehnta addresses both the efficiency and effectiveness problems that plague traditional B2B advertising approaches. The AI-powered automation reduces the technical barriers that often prevent smaller marketing teams from running sophisticated campaigns, while the market intelligence features provide value that extends well beyond just lead generation. However, teams need to be committed to Google Ads as a primary channel and comfortable with usage-based pricing that can scale quickly with ambitious targeting strategies.
