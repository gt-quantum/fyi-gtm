## What is Regie?

Regie is an AI-powered sales engagement platform that positions itself as the world's first comprehensive AI Sales Engagement Platform (SEP). The tool combines human sales representatives with AI-driven sales development representatives to automate the entire prospecting workflow, from sourcing and sorting prospects to executing multi-channel outreach campaigns across email, social media, and phone calls.

## Decision Snapshot

- **Best for:** Mid-market and enterprise sales teams looking to scale personalized outreach without adding headcount
- **Not ideal for:** Small businesses with simple CRM needs or teams requiring deep lead nurturing capabilities
- **Typical team size:** 5-50+ sales representatives
- **Time to value:** 2-4 weeks for basic setup and initial campaign deployment
- **Budget reality:** Expect significant investment with custom pricing plus $150-200 per rep monthly for AI dialing features

## Quick Facts

- **Category:** Sales Engagement Platform
- **Pricing model:** Enterprise-level custom pricing with usage-based add-ons
- **Standout capability:** AI-human hybrid prospecting with autonomous prospect sourcing and engagement

## What the Tool Does

Regie operates as a comprehensive sales engagement hub where AI agents work alongside human sales representatives to execute prospecting campaigns. The platform starts by automatically sourcing prospects from its native database of over 220 million contacts, applying firmographic and intent data filters to identify high-quality targets. Once prospects are identified, the AI system creates personalized outreach sequences across multiple channels, timing messages based on engagement patterns and prospect behavior.

The day-to-day workflow centers around the RegieOne dashboard, where sales teams can monitor AI-driven campaigns, review prospect interactions, and step in for high-value conversations. Sales representatives can build custom workflows based on specific personas, buying intent signals, or market triggers, then let the AI system execute these plays automatically. The platform continuously learns from engagement data to optimize message timing, content personalization, and channel selection for each prospect.

## Key Capabilities

### AI-Powered Prospect Sourcing and Qualification
The platform automatically identifies and qualifies prospects using its built-in database and intent data tracking. This eliminates manual list building and ensures sales teams focus on engaged, qualified opportunities. The AI analyzes firmographic data, buying signals, and behavioral patterns to score and prioritize prospects for outreach campaigns.

### Multi-Channel Automated Outreach
Regie executes coordinated campaigns across email, LinkedIn, and phone calls through its AI dialing feature. The system personalizes messages at scale using prospect data and company information, then adjusts outreach timing and frequency based on engagement responses. This approach maintains consistent touchpoints without overwhelming prospects or requiring constant manual intervention.

### Dynamic Workflow Automation
Sales teams can create sophisticated automation workflows that trigger based on specific conditions like job title changes, company funding events, or website visits. The AI system then executes appropriate outreach sequences, escalating promising conversations to human representatives while continuing to nurture less-engaged prospects through automated follow-up campaigns.

## Pricing Reality

Regie follows an enterprise pricing model that lacks transparent public pricing, requiring sales consultations to determine actual costs. The complexity becomes apparent with add-on features, particularly the AI dialing capability that costs an additional $150-200 per sales representative monthly.

- **Entry cost:** Custom quote required, but expect enterprise-level investment
- **Scaling cost:** Linear scaling with team size, plus significant add-on fees for advanced features
- **Contract terms:** Typically annual commitments with enterprise-level minimums

For perspective, a five-person sales team using AI dialing features would face additional monthly costs of $750-1,000 beyond the base platform fee. Organizations should budget carefully for the full feature set they intend to use.

## Pros & Cons

### Pros
- **Massive time savings:** Users report significant reduction in manual prospecting tasks, with AI handling routine sourcing and initial outreach automatically
- **Personalization at scale:** The platform generates contextually relevant messages for hundreds of prospects simultaneously, maintaining personal touch without manual effort  
- **Comprehensive channel coverage:** Single platform manages email, social media, and phone outreach with coordinated timing and messaging consistency

### Cons
- **Integration limitations:** Users report challenges connecting with existing CRM systems and sales tools, potentially creating workflow disruptions
- **Generic content generation:** When prospect data is limited, the AI produces less compelling, more generic messaging that may reduce engagement rates
- **Complex pricing structure:** Hidden costs and add-on fees make budget planning difficult, with significant additional expenses for key features like AI dialing

## What Users Say

User feedback reveals strong appreciation for the platform's core automation capabilities, with many praising the time savings and personalization features. One user noted: "I could not imagine being in this Enablement position or even a sales position without the platform. I'm kind of jealous of the SDRs who are currently using it."

**Common praise**
- Exceptional speed in generating conversational, personalized messaging
- Effective AI dialer feature that increases connection rates
- Significant reduction in manual prospecting workload

**Common complaints**
- Limited lead nurturing capabilities compared to comprehensive CRM platforms
- Sync difficulties and integration challenges with existing sales technology
- Content quality inconsistency when working with incomplete prospect data

The platform maintains strong user ratings with 4.4/5 stars on G2 from 337 reviews and 4/5 stars on Capterra, indicating generally positive user experiences despite some operational challenges.

## Who Is It For (and Not For)

**Good fit if you are:**
- Mid-market or enterprise sales organization looking to scale outbound prospecting without adding headcount
- Sales team comfortable with AI-driven processes and willing to adapt existing workflows
- Organization with budget flexibility for enterprise-level sales technology investment

**Not a fit if you are:**
- Small business needing simple, cost-effective CRM functionality
- Team requiring deep lead nurturing and comprehensive customer relationship management
- Organization with limited budget for sales technology or preference for transparent pricing

## Verdict

**Bottom line:** Regie excels at automating outbound prospecting for teams ready to invest in AI-driven sales engagement, but integration challenges and complex pricing require careful evaluation.

The platform delivers genuine value for organizations seeking to scale personalized outreach without proportional headcount increases. The AI-human hybrid approach addresses real pain points in modern sales prospecting, particularly the time-intensive nature of manual outreach and the challenge of maintaining personalization at scale. However, potential users should carefully assess integration requirements with existing systems and budget for the full cost of advanced features like AI dialing. Teams with simpler needs or tighter budgets may find better value in more straightforward sales engagement tools, while organizations ready for comprehensive AI-driven prospecting transformation will find Regie's capabilities compelling despite the investment required.
