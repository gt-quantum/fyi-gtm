## What is RB2B?

RB2B is a website visitor identification platform that transforms anonymous website traffic into actionable sales leads by revealing the actual people browsing your site. The tool uses tracking pixels to identify visitors and provides detailed contact information including names, job titles, LinkedIn profiles, and email addresses, enabling precise B2B outreach. It's designed specifically for B2B companies looking to convert website visitors into qualified leads through real-time identification and intelligent lead scoring.

## Decision Snapshot

- **Best for:** B2B service companies with high-value offerings ($2K+ monthly or $200K+ one-time deals)
- **Not ideal for:** Budget-conscious small teams or companies targeting non-US markets
- **Typical team size:** 10-50 person sales and marketing teams
- **Time to value:** Under 5 minutes for initial setup, meaningful leads within first week
- **Budget reality:** $149-499/month for most teams after free tier exhaustion

## Quick Facts

- **Category:** Intent Signals & Visitor Identification
- **Pricing model:** Freemium with credit-based paid tiers
- **Standout capability:** Person-level visitor identification with LinkedIn profile enrichment

## What the Tool Does

RB2B works by placing a tracking pixel on your website that monitors visitor behavior and uses IP address analysis combined with data enrichment to identify specific individuals browsing your site. When someone visits your website, the tool cross-references their digital footprint with LinkedIn and other professional databases to build complete visitor profiles.

The platform operates through real-time notifications, typically delivered via Slack integration, where sales teams receive instant alerts when qualified prospects visit their website. These notifications include the visitor's full professional profile, current job title, company information, and contact details, allowing sales representatives to reach out while the prospect's interest is still fresh.

The workflow centers around transforming passive website analytics into active sales opportunities. Instead of seeing generic company visits in Google Analytics, teams get actionable intelligence about specific decision-makers who are actively researching their solutions. This enables immediate, personalized outreach based on the pages visited and content consumed.

## Key Capabilities

### Real-Time Visitor Identification
- Reveals individual visitors with complete professional profiles including LinkedIn data
- Provides immediate access to contact information and job titles for precise targeting
- Enables sales teams to know exactly who is researching their products, not just which companies

### Hot Lead Intelligence and Tagging
- Automatically flags high-fit prospects using Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) filters
- Tracks visits to high-intent pages like pricing, case studies, or product demos
- Delivers qualified lead notifications to sales reps within 30 seconds of website activity

### Integration-First Lead Management
- Pushes lead intelligence directly to Slack channels for immediate team visibility
- Connects with major CRM platforms including HubSpot, Salesforce, and Demandbase
- Integrates with workflow tools like Clay and Zapier for automated lead nurturing sequences

## Pricing Reality

RB2B operates on a credit-based pricing model where each visitor identification consumes one credit. The pricing structure is designed to scale with usage volume and team requirements.

- **Entry cost:** Free plan includes 150 monthly credits with core Slack integration
- **Scaling cost:** Pro plans range from $149/month (300 credits) to $499/month (2000 credits)
- **Contract terms:** Monthly billing available with annual discounts offered

The free tier provides genuine value for small teams or those testing the platform, while paid plans unlock advanced features like CRM integrations and enhanced data enrichment. Teams requiring more than 2000 monthly identifications need custom enterprise pricing. Most mid-market teams find the $249-349/month range provides adequate credit allocation for consistent lead generation.

## Pros & Cons

### Pros
- **Immediate implementation:** G2 reviewers consistently note "integration worked perfectly out of the box" with 5-minute setup times
- **Person-level precision:** Unlike company-only tools, RB2B identifies specific individuals, enabling highly targeted outreach
- **Real-time notifications:** Sales teams receive instant Slack alerts when qualified prospects visit, maximizing conversion timing

### Cons
- **Geographic limitations:** Individual visitor identification currently only works for US-based traffic, limiting global applicability  
- **Data quality inconsistency:** Relies heavily on LinkedIn profile matching, occasionally resulting in incomplete or missing visitor information
- **Credit consumption model:** The per-identification pricing can become expensive for high-traffic websites with broad visitor bases

## What Users Say

User feedback reveals strong satisfaction with RB2B's core functionality while highlighting some practical limitations.

**Common praise**
- Seamless integration experience with existing sales and marketing stacks
- Significant improvement in lead response times and conversion rates
- High-quality LinkedIn profile data when matches are successfully found

**Common complaints** 
- Credit-based pricing becomes costly for teams with high website traffic volumes
- Data enrichment doesn't consistently achieve the 70-80% contact-level completion rates some teams expect

One user noted that RB2B "revolutionized how our sales team approaches website leads - instead of guessing who visited from a company, we know exactly which decision-maker to contact." However, budget-conscious teams frequently mention that the credit consumption model requires careful visitor qualification to maintain cost-effectiveness.

## Who Is It For (and Not For)

**Good fit if you are:**
- B2B service companies with high-value contracts where individual lead identification justifies the per-credit cost
- Sales teams focused primarily on US market prospects and decision-makers
- Organizations with established sales processes that can quickly act on real-time lead intelligence
- Companies already using Slack, HubSpot, or Salesforce who want seamless workflow integration

**Not a fit if you are:**
- Small teams with tight budgets who cannot justify $149+ monthly costs for lead identification
- Businesses targeting international markets outside the US where individual identification is limited
- High-traffic websites where broad visitor identification would consume credits too quickly
- Teams lacking immediate response capabilities to capitalize on real-time lead notifications

## Verdict

**Bottom line:** RB2B excels at transforming website visitors into actionable sales opportunities for US-focused B2B teams with high-value offerings.

The platform delivers genuine value through person-level visitor identification that most competing tools cannot match. The real-time Slack notifications and seamless CRM integrations create efficient workflows for sales teams ready to act on hot leads immediately. However, the geographic limitations and credit-based pricing model mean it's not universally applicable. Teams with substantial US traffic, high-value deals, and quick response capabilities will find RB2B transforms their lead generation approach, while budget-conscious or internationally-focused organizations might need alternatives that better match their constraints and market focus.
