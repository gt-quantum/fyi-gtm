## What is Vector?

Vector is a contact-level advertising platform that transforms how B2B companies identify and target potential buyers. Unlike traditional advertising tools that focus on broad audience segments, Vector leverages AI to analyze over 400 million signals in real-time, turning CRM data and buyer activity into precise, contact-specific ad audiences.

The platform positions itself as the world's only Relationship Intelligence platform, designed to help marketers "fill the funnel with high intent contacts, not meaningless accounts." By tracking job changes, site visits, competitor research, and other behavioral signals, Vector promises to uncover the real people looking to buy before you spend your advertising budget.

Founded by a team backed by notable investors including Y Combinator, SignalFire, and GoAhead Ventures, Vector recently raised $2.6 million in funding and serves over 1,000+ teams. The platform's core mission revolves around revolutionizing lead generation through proprietary SiteID technology that unifies signals across multiple touchpoints.

## Key Features

**Contact-Level Ad Targeting**
Vector's flagship feature connects your contact data directly to major advertising platforms including LinkedIn, Google, and Meta. Rather than targeting broad demographics, you can create ad audiences based on specific individuals in your CRM, their recent activities, and behavioral patterns. The platform tracks engagement across websites, ads, and web interactions to build comprehensive contact profiles.

**Real-Time Buyer Intelligence**
The platform monitors buying research across thousands of topics, analyzing billions of signals to identify when prospects are actively researching solutions. This includes tracking competitor research, content consumption patterns, and engagement with industry-related topics. The AI processes job changes, company announcements, and other trigger events that indicate buying intent.

**Anonymous Visitor Identification**
Vector's SiteID technology identifies anonymous website visitors and transforms them into actionable contact information. When someone visits your site, the platform can reveal their identity, company details, and recent activity. This data can be pushed directly into Slack for real-time notifications, enabling immediate follow-up on high-intent prospects.

**Advanced Filtering and Segmentation**
Users can narrow their target lists by filtering demographics, firmographics, and buying journey stage. The platform allows you to segment audiences based on company size, industry, role, recent activities, and engagement levels. This granular control helps ensure your ads reach the most relevant prospects at the right time.

**Cross-Platform Integration**
Vector integrates with popular CRM systems, marketing automation platforms, and communication tools. The platform syncs data across your existing tech stack, ensuring contact information and behavioral insights are available where your team needs them most.

## Pricing

Vector operates on a freemium model, offering a free tier to get started, though specific pricing details for paid plans aren't publicly detailed on their website. The free tier includes basic functionality but comes with limited integrations, which is noted as a reasonable trade-off for a newer product in the market.

Industry feedback suggests Vector is positioned as more affordable than comparable enterprise tools like ZoomInfo and RB2B, making it accessible to mid-market companies that need sophisticated buyer intelligence without enterprise-level budgets. However, potential users should contact Vector directly for detailed pricing information on their paid tiers and enterprise features.

The pricing structure appears designed to let teams test the platform's core functionality before committing to paid features, which aligns with Vector's focus on proving ROI before asking for significant investment.

## Pros & Cons

### Pros

**Rapid Setup and Implementation**
Users consistently praise Vector's quick setup process, with reports of getting from signup to seeing identified website visitors in just 4 minutes. This ease of implementation removes a common barrier that plagues more complex marketing intelligence platforms.

**High-Quality Data and Accuracy**
The platform receives strong feedback for data accuracy and the quality of contact identification. Users report that Vector successfully identifies genuinely high-intent prospects rather than generating noise, leading to better conversion rates and more efficient ad spend.

**Effective Lead Generation Results**
Real users report discovering tens of thousands of new buyers and achieving high conversion rates through Vector's targeted approach. The platform's ability to identify in-market buyers before competitors appears to deliver meaningful competitive advantages.

**Strong Customer Support**
Vector receives positive feedback for responsive customer support, with users noting the team's helpfulness in onboarding and optimizing campaigns for better results.

### Cons

**Limited Integration Options**
As a newer platform, Vector currently offers fewer integrations compared to established competitors. While users note this is understandable for a emerging product, it may require workarounds for companies with complex tech stacks.

**Geographic Limitations**
Some users report limitations when targeting non-US markets, suggesting Vector's data coverage and accuracy may be stronger in North American markets compared to international prospects.

**Customer Support Inconsistencies**
While many users praise support quality, there are occasional mentions of support experiences that didn't meet expectations, suggesting some inconsistency in service delivery.

## What Users Say

User sentiment around Vector is generally positive, particularly among teams focused on B2B lead generation and account-based marketing. Users frequently highlight the platform's ability to identify anonymous website visitors and transform that data into actionable sales opportunities.

Marketing teams appreciate Vector's approach to contact-level targeting, noting that it helps them move beyond spray-and-pray advertising tactics toward more personalized, effective campaigns. The real-time nature of the insights receives particular praise, with users valuing immediate notifications when high-intent prospects engage with their content.

Sales teams report that Vector's buyer intelligence helps them time their outreach more effectively, reaching prospects when they're actively researching solutions rather than making cold calls to uninterested contacts. The integration with Slack for real-time notifications is frequently mentioned as a workflow improvement.

However, some users note that maximizing Vector's potential requires ongoing optimization and that results improve as the platform learns more about your ideal customer profile and buying patterns.

## Who Is It For?

**B2B Marketing Teams**
Vector is particularly well-suited for B2B marketing teams running paid advertising campaigns on LinkedIn, Google, or Meta who want to improve targeting precision and reduce wasted ad spend. Marketing managers who need to demonstrate ROI on advertising investments will find Vector's contact-level attribution valuable.

**Account-Based Marketing Programs**
Companies running ABM initiatives can leverage Vector to identify when target accounts show buying signals, enabling more timely and relevant outreach. The platform's ability to track competitor research and industry engagement makes it valuable for ABM practitioners.

**Sales Development Representatives**
SDRs benefit from Vector's real-time buyer intelligence and anonymous visitor identification, allowing them to prioritize outreach to prospects showing active interest rather than working through cold lists.

**Growing SaaS Companies**
Vector appears particularly valuable for SaaS companies in the growth stage that need sophisticated buyer intelligence but can't justify enterprise-level tool costs. The platform's focus on identifying high-intent prospects aligns well with SaaS sales cycles.

**Companies with Existing CRM Data**
Organizations with substantial contact databases can maximize Vector's value by turning existing CRM data into more effective advertising audiences. The platform works best when it has quality contact data to enhance with behavioral insights.

## Verdict

Vector represents an interesting evolution in B2B advertising technology, addressing a real pain point around targeting precision and buyer identification. The platform's focus on contact-level advertising rather than broad demographic targeting aligns well with the trend toward more personalized, account-based marketing approaches.

The standout strength is Vector's rapid implementation and immediate value delivery – being able to identify website visitors and create targeted ad audiences within minutes of setup is genuinely impressive. For marketing teams frustrated with poor conversion rates from traditional advertising approaches, Vector's buyer intelligence capabilities offer a compelling alternative.

However, Vector is still a relatively young platform, and the limited integration options may require additional workflow adjustments for companies with complex marketing stacks. The geographic limitations also suggest it may be less suitable for companies with significant international markets.

For B2B companies running digital advertising campaigns and looking to improve targeting precision, Vector deserves serious consideration. The freemium model allows for low-risk testing, and early user feedback suggests the platform delivers on its core promises around identifying high-intent prospects.

The key question for potential users is whether Vector's contact-level advertising approach aligns with their sales process and whether they have sufficient CRM data to maximize the platform's capabilities. For companies meeting these criteria, Vector appears to offer meaningful advantages over traditional advertising targeting methods.
